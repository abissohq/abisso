# Issue tracker: GitHub

Engineering work items are tracked in GitHub Issues. The six authoritative product and engineering specifications remain under `docs/product/` and `docs/architecture/`.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: use `gh issue list` with appropriate state and label filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` handles this automatically inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface
